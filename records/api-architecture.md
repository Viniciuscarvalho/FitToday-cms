# api-architecture

The API layer connects the FitToday CMS to the iOS app (and future Android app). This design map tracks decisions about endpoint design, authentication flow, data serialization, and API versioning.

## Core Decisions
(Records will be added here as architecture is documented)

## Tensions
(Unresolved architectural trade-offs)

## Open Questions
- How will API versioning work when Android launches?
- What caching strategy should the mobile apps use?
- How should pagination work for large workout lists?
