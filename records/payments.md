# payments

Stripe Connect powers the payment infrastructure for FitToday. Each trainer has a connected account, and the platform handles subscription billing, trainer payouts, and platform fees.

## Core Decisions
(Records will be added here as payment architecture is documented)

## Tensions
(Unresolved payment flow trade-offs)

## Open Questions
- How should failed subscription payments be handled?
- What's the platform fee structure for trainers?
- How do refunds flow through connected accounts?
