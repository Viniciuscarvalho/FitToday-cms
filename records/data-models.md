# data-models

The data layer underlying FitToday. Workouts, exercises, users, trainers, students, and their relationships. This map tracks data model decisions, schema evolution, and database design choices.

## Core Decisions
(Records will be added here as data models are documented)

## Tensions
(Unresolved data model trade-offs)

## Open Questions
- How are workout templates vs assigned workouts structured?
- What's the relationship between exercises and workout plans?
- How does the PDF sharing feature affect workout data models?
